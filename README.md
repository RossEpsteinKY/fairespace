This repository will be used to keep track of research and development conducted in this class. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Step 1

Go to your settings tab and rename your repository from  "CourseCode-YYMM-LastFirst-AccountName" to follow this naming convention... **CourseCode-YearMonth-LastFirst**  

**Examples:**   
WDD4416-2112-DoeJohn  
WDD463-2112-DoeJohn

Update the About section of the repo to match this naming convention as well. 


## Step 2

After saving the new name for your repository, clone down a local copy and then continue to review open activities for this week on FSO.  



## Step 3

Attend the first Live Session. If you are unable to attend the upcoming Live Session, view the video which is usually posted to the live sessions activity within a day of the event. You can then begin to work on assignments as they become available.

### Next Steps... 
After completing the above steps, update this read me with your own text. Delete all of the above text including this paragraph. You will then need to customize this read me to describe what this repository contains. Use the text below as a starting point and customize the text with your own words. As you make updates to your work each week, continue to update this readme file. Use the readme to explain your ongoing updates to this repository. To receive credit for your research and development, be sure to also upate your documentation each week.

### First Last / Student ID: 000####### 
 Hello my name is Ross Epstein . I am a BA of Web Design and Development student from Kentucky. Here's some additional information about me:  I tour as a performer on the Renaissance Faire Circuit as "Luku the Mad Skald".  I spend a good 7 months of the year doing this including two shows in Florida, one in Connecticut, and one in Kentucky, as well as a few one weekend shows here and there.  I have also been a full stack web developer since 2017, and am currently working for the USDA - Forest Service.

## Progress Check / Stand Up
Each week, I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by including a **Stand-Up**. A "stand-up" is when I take the time to briefly report out on the following...

1. **Accomplishments** - What I worked on this past week
2. **Challenges** - Any challenges I may have (and how I am addressing those challenges)
3. **Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next 

<br>

**Week 1**: Replace this paragraph with a brief "stand-up" (use steps 1-3 above as a guide on what to write about). Summarize your most recent milestone activity and work. What did you achieve? Are there any challenges? Describe your next steps and how you plan to prioritize your time. 3-4 sentences is acceptable. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use this as an opportunity to report out on progress. 

**Week 2**: Next Stand up... Milestone 2    

**Week 3**:    

**Week 4**:
