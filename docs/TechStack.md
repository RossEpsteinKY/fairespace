# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your familiarly and comfort level with each piece of technology.


## Adobe XD

You are going to be using XD to create click-through designs of your application. It is recommended that you use an UI kit for a visual framework to help you design your applications as similarly to the potential live version as possible.

**How comfortable do you feel with XD?**
Truthfully?  I abhor it.  I have been a full stack developer professionally for going on six years and rarely, if ever other than during FSU classes, have had to even touch wireframing.  I am not a UI from scratch type of guy.  I am a "you tell me what you want, I will build it" type of guy.  I also am a firm believer in templating engines or boilerplate UI such as Tailwind.

**What are your concerns around using XD?**
See above.

## React

You will be utilizing React as your front-end framework. You will be expected to use moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.

**How comfortable do you feel with React?**
Very comfortable with it.  I use it professionally, and built a CRM application that recently launched called KringleTracker.

**What are your concerns around using React?**
None.

## Redux

Redux will be used to control your data and have proper data flow for your app. You will be expected to create well organized reducers, well built actions, and connected components.

**How comfortable do you feel with Redux?**
Moderately.

**What are your concerns around using Redux?**
Haven't used it in ages.

## Node

You will be using Node as your server for both your API and to render your front-end. You will be required to use best practices, npm, and npx.

**How comfortable do you feel with Node?**
Very.  I prefer it with typeorm, however.

**What are your concerns around using Node?**
Raw NodeJS has been a bit for me.

## Express

You will be using express as your framework for your API. You will be using and building middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

**How comfortable do you feel with Express?**
I am fine with it.

**What are your concerns around using Express?**
None.

## SQL/Posgres/Sequelize

You will be utilizing a relational database with Sequelize as an ORM. You will be creating migrations, models, and seeds as well utilizing the models with full validated CRUD.

**How comfortable do you feel with Sequelize?**
Decently so.  It's sort of like the cousin of TypeORM.

**What are your concerns around using Sequelize?**
It's less fluidly written than TypeORM and I find it to be a bit less powerful and more cumbersome.
